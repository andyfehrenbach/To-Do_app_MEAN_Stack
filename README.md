# To-Do App Using MEAN Stack
This school assignment is and upgrade of our previous assignment that used a SQL database and JQuery DOM manipulation.
It now uses Angular for the MVC and stores data in a Mongo Database. I much prefer this version of the assignment and am proud of my clean user interface and improved functionality with Angular.
